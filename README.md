# Replant ( SPECIAL!) 
Required Plugin: https://modrinth.com/plugin/kotlinplugins
- This plugin automatically replants fully grown crops like wheat, carrots, potatoes, beetroots, and nether warts. When a player harvests a mature crop, the plugin replants it after half-second delay. Additionally, it ensures that all harvested items are dropped naturally at the crop's location, providing a seamless and efficient farming experience.
